In a land where the sun always shines,
Lived a man with too many felines.
His house was a zoo,
With cats of all hue,
But he swore each was worth all the fines!

With tails of all shapes and sizes,
They caused quite a few surprises.
They’d nap on his bed,
Or perch on his head,
Leaving him with comical compromises!

But despite the chaos they’d bring,
He’d never trade a single thing.
For in their quirky way,
They brightened his day,
With purrs, and meows, and a fling!

So if you're feeling a little down,
Remember this whimsical town.
With cats galore,
You'll laugh evermore,
And chase away any lingering frown!
